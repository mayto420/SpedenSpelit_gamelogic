# SpedenSpelit_gamelogic
A portion of the code written for an Arduino-based reaction/guessing game. This is not intended to be functional and is merely for demonstration purposes. In order to function it requires a specific Arduino-based device with buttons, LEDs and a 7-segment display, along with the accompanying code that operates them. (Written by other people for this project)
For demonstration only.
